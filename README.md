# Microsoft Making Movies

### Author: [Elizabeth Webster](https://github.com/elizabeth524)

## Overview

This project analyzes profit, return on investment, and ratings of different movies in order to make educated suggestions to microsoft on how to create a successful film.

## Business Problem

Microsoft has decided to branch out and begin making films, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. We will be looking at the types of films that are currently doing the best at the box office in order to advise Microsoft on how to proceed with their project.

## Data

We will be using datasets from the following websites in our analysis:

* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

This data will give us access to movie titles, genres, production budgets, revenues, ratings, and crew.

## Methods

In this project, we will be using descriptive analysis to find genres with the highest profit and return on investment, release dates with the highest revenue, and directors with the highest ratings.

## Results

The top five most profitable genres are Animation, Adventure, Musical, Fantasy, and Family.

The return on investment is highest for the following five genres: Musical, Family, Mystery, Horror, and Fantasy.

The highest revenues are from filmds released in May, June, July, or November.

The top 15 highest rated directors are all fairly close in their ratings.

## Suggestions

This analysis lead me to three suggestions for Microsoft in regards to their first film:

* Based off of our genre findings, the genres that appear in the top 5 for both profit and ROI are Family, Fantasy, and Musicals.  I would recommend producing a **Family** or **Fantasy** movie.  The only reason I would not recommend a Musical is because they seem to have high stats due to Disney.

* I would recommend releasing a movie in either **June**, **July**, or **November**.  Historically, movies seem to do the best when released in these months.  If Microsoft decides to make a Family film, I would suggest releasing in one of the summer months when children are out of school.

* Although the top 15 directors are all very close in average rating, I would reccommend hiring one of the top three: **Josh Lowell**, **Paul Dugdale**, or **Roger Lay Jr**.

## Next Steps

In this project, we have really just scratched the surface on what makes a great film.  For further analysis, some of the areas we could look at are:

* Highest grossing production companies and the genres that they tend to lean towards.
* Establish the number of films released in each month vs average gross revenue.  If significantly more movies are released in June, July, and November, then it might not be as important that those are the top grossing months.
* The genre that each of the top fifteen directors specializes in and see how they relate to the first two graphs we created.
